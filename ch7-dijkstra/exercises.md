**7.1**

In each graph, what is the weight of the shortest path from start to finish.

*Check book for graph diagrams*

* A - `Start --> 5 --> 2 --> 1 --> Finish` (Total 8)
* B -  `Start --> 10 --> 20 --> 30 --> Finish` (Total 60)
* C - This graph has a negative weighted edge. Although we can see the path is `Start --> 2 --> 2 --> 2 --> 2 --> Finish` (Total of 8).
